This is the core STEMCraft Library plugin that provides the core functionality and helper methods for the STEMCraft server and other STEMCraft Plugins.

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Paper 1.21.3 or higher

## Todo

- The plugin continues to use the depreciated `plugin.getDescription()` method for plugin data. The replacement method of `plugin.getPluginMeta()` is marked as experimental and is not recommended for use in production. This will be updated when the method is no longer experimental.

## Usage

You can visit the [Wiki](/wiki) for details on the plugin commands, classes, and using as a dependency.
